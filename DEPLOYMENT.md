# Hudson Desktop Deployment (Tauri + Phoenix)

Ship Hudson as a cross‑platform desktop app using **Tauri** as the shell, while keeping the existing **Phoenix/LiveView** UI and adding a **SQLite + Neon** hybrid data layer plus media caching.

## 🎯 Quick Start (Pilot)

**The pilot is complete and working!** To test the native desktop app:

```bash
./run_native.sh
```

This launches a native macOS window with the full Hudson LiveView UI, backed by a 25MB single-binary BEAM release with SQLite local cache.

### Database Modes

The app supports three database modes via `HUDSON_ENABLE_NEON`:

```bash
# Local Postgres (default for development)
./run_native.sh                              # or double-click Hudson.app

# Neon cloud database (production)
HUDSON_ENABLE_NEON=true DATABASE_URL=... ./run_native.sh

# Offline mode (SQLite only)
HUDSON_ENABLE_NEON=false ./run_native.sh
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### App Hangs on "Starting Hudson..." (Dock Launch)

**Symptom**: App works when launched from terminal but hangs when launched from Finder/dock.

**Cause**: Missing network entitlements or missing platform-specific binary symlink.

**Fix**:
1. Ensure `src-tauri/entitlements.plist` exists with network permissions
2. Create symlink in app bundle:
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Hudson.app/Contents/MacOS
   ln -sf hudson_macos_arm hudson_macos_arm-aarch64-apple-darwin
   ```
3. Remove dock bookmark and re-add it

### Backend Code Changes Not Reflected

**Symptom**: Rebuilt the burrito binary but app still uses old code.

**Cause**: Burrito caches the extracted runtime in `~/Library/Application Support/.burrito/`.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Clear burrito cache
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/.burrito/hudson_erts-*

# Rebuild
MIX_ENV=prod mix release --overwrite
cargo tauri build

# Create symlink (if needed for dock)
cd src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Hudson.app/Contents/MacOS
ln -sf hudson_macos_arm hudson_macos_arm-aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### Pages Show "Internal Server Error"

**Symptom**: App starts but pages like `/products` crash.

**Cause**: Page tries to query `Hudson.Repo` (Postgres) which isn't running in offline mode.

**Fix**: Either:
- Use `HUDSON_ENABLE_NEON=local` to connect to local Postgres (recommended for development)
- Or update the page to gracefully handle offline mode (check if Repo is started)

## 📌 Latest Progress (2025-11-17)
- ✅ **Database mode configuration complete**: Added three-mode `HUDSON_ENABLE_NEON` support:
  - `true` - Neon cloud database (production)
  - `local` - Local PostgreSQL (development, now the default)
  - `false` - Offline mode (SQLite only)
- ✅ **macOS entitlements added**: Created `src-tauri/entitlements.plist` with network permissions to fix `:eperm` errors when launching app via dock
- ✅ **Burrito cache location documented**: `~/Library/Application Support/.burrito/hudson_erts-*/` - must be cleared when updating backend code
- ✅ **App bundle symlink fix**: Added `hudson_macos_arm-aarch64-apple-darwin` symlink in app bundle for dock launches
- ✅ **Default mode changed to local**: Both Tauri app and `run_native.sh` now default to local Postgres for easier development
- ✅ Added a minimal **local sync operations queue** on SQLite with helpers + tests. Supports enqueue/pending/done/failed. Sync worker/backoff to Neon is still pending.
- ✅ Burrito targets are now configurable via `HUDSON_BURRITO_TARGETS`. Default: macOS ARM. `all` adds macOS Intel + Windows targets (see `mix.exs` release config).
- ✅ **Tauri automated bundling now working!** Bundle created at `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Hudson.app` and verified working with `./run_native.sh`.

## ⚠️ Current State vs Future State

**This document describes the TARGET architecture for production-ready desktop deployment.**

### ✅ Completed (Pilot - macOS ARM only)
- ✅ Phoenix LiveView app running in desktop mode with three database modes (Neon/local/offline)
- ✅ Shopify & OpenAI API integrations
- ✅ esbuild asset pipeline (no npm)
- ✅ Oban background jobs
- ✅ **Tauri desktop shell** - spawns BEAM, reads handshake, loads WebView, handles lifecycle
- ✅ **Burrito single-binary packaging (macOS ARM)** - 25MB binary with all NIFs validated
- ✅ **Health check endpoint** (`/healthz`)
- ✅ **Port handshake mechanism** (`/tmp/hudson_port.json`)
- ✅ **SQLite local cache structure** (schema + auto-migrations on startup)
- ✅ **Secure storage pattern** (file-based for pilot, OS keychain ready for production)
- ✅ **macOS entitlements** for network access (dock launches working)
- ✅ **Three-mode database config** (`HUDSON_ENABLE_NEON`: true/local/false)

### 🔄 Next Phase: Production-Ready Desktop
- ❌ Multi-platform support (Windows, macOS Intel) - pilot is macOS ARM only
- ❌ Sync worker/backoff to push local SQLite queue to Neon (queue + schema exist, worker pending)
- ❌ Full OS keychain/DPAPI integration (currently file-based)
- ❌ First-run wizard UI (bootstrap code exists, needs UI)
- ❌ Media cache system (not implemented)
- ❌ Auto-update mechanism (not implemented)
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline with code signing (not configured)

## Goals
- Preserve current LiveView UI; avoid template rewrites.
- Better desktop UX: native window/tray, smoother updates, no exposed public port, notarized/signable installers.
- Lower latency and add offline tolerance with a local cache (SQLite + media cache) while keeping Neon as the source of truth.
- Reduce deployment risk: no client-run DB migrations; safer secrets handling; integrity-checked updates.

## High-Level Architecture
- **Tauri shell** (Rust): boots BEAM release, manages lifecycle, native menus/tray, updater, and loads the Phoenix UI in the WebView (`http://127.0.0.1:<ephemeral_port>`). No UI rewrite.
- **Phoenix/LiveView** (unchanged UI): served locally. Endpoint binds to loopback on an ephemeral port handed to Tauri.
- **Data**: SQLite for low-latency/offline cache + Neon Postgres for authoritative data. Operation queue syncs to Neon with retries/conflict rules.
- **Media**: disk cache keyed by URL with TTL/size cap; prefetch per session.
- **Updates**: Tauri updater (or custom) with signature + checksum verification and rollback.

## Detailed Plan

### 1) Desktop Shell (Tauri)
- Add a Tauri workspace with a minimal Rust command that:
  - Spawns the Burrito/BEAM release as a child process.
  - Reads the chosen port from a small handshake file (`/tmp/hudson_port.json` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Hudson\port.json` on Windows) containing `{"port": <int>}`; fallback: parse the first `PORT:<int>` line on stdout.
  - Waits for `/healthz` on that port with timeout/backoff, then loads WebView to that URL.
  - For shutdown, sends a TERM to BEAM and waits; on update, stop BEAM before replacing binaries.
- Disable remote content in WebView; allow only `127.0.0.1` + `localhost`. Set a strict Content-Security-Policy.
- Native chrome: menu/tray shortcut to open settings, restart, check for updates, open logs.

### 2) Runtime Bootstrap (Elixir)
- Adjust `config/runtime.exs` to:
  - Load persisted settings/creds from keychain/DPAPI-backed store; do **not** raise when env is missing on first run.
  - Generate `secret_key_base` on first run and persist in secure storage (not alongside the creds file).
  - Pick a random available port (unless `PORT` set), bind to `{127,0,0,1}`, and write the port to the handshake file for Tauri.
  - Keep Repo pool small (3–5) and tolerant of reconnects; add backoff/circuit-breaker behavior for Neon connectivity.
- Secure storage libraries:
  - macOS: OS Keychain via a small adapter (e.g., `:keychainx` or a Rust shim exposed via NIF/Port) with `get/put/delete`.
  - Windows: DPAPI/WinCred via adapter (e.g., `:wincred` or Rust bridge) with the same `get/put/delete` surface.

### 3) Data Layer: SQLite + Neon
- Add a local SQLite file (`~/Library/Application Support/Hudson/local.db` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Hudson\local.db` on Windows).
- Define schema and migrations for SQLite separately from Neon. Keep them tiny and stable; **auto-run SQLite migrations on client startup** (safe because local).
- Add a sync/queue process:
  - Write ops to SQLite first; enqueue outbound mutations to Neon with retries/backoff.
  - On startup/online, pull deltas from Neon (timestamp/high-water mark) and reconcile (domain-specific conflict rules or last-write-wins).
  - For read paths, prefer SQLite cached data; fall back to Neon on cache miss when online.
- Keep Oban/Notifiers: run workers only if they are local-only tasks; otherwise point Oban to Neon via small pools and handle latency or disable as needed.
- Do **not** run `ecto.migrate` against Neon from clients. Migrations run in CI/CD before releasing binaries. On startup, check Neon schema version; if too far ahead, show “Update required” and refuse to start to avoid drift.
  - Schema gate: read `SELECT max(version) FROM schema_migrations`; if client code expects `N` and Neon is > N, require update before proceeding (threshold default 0).
- Conflict rules (initial pass):
  - Product catalog: last-write-wins (Shopify is source of truth; prefer fresh pull).
  - Session state (per user/session): local-first; sync up, but conflicts prompt user to choose.
  - Talking points/AI generations: append-only with timestamps; dedupe on merge.
  - Provide a conflict UI/log for visibility on auto-resolutions.

### 4) Media Cache
- Add a Req-based downloader with disk cache (URL-keyed) with TTL + LRU/size cap (default: **500MB cap, 7-day TTL**, configurable in settings).
- Prefetch session media when online; on offline, serve cached assets or placeholders.
- Store cache under the same app-data root (`media-cache/`). Periodic cleanup task.

### 5) Credentials & Secrets
- Storage: OS keychain (macOS) / DPAPI (Windows). If a file store is unavoidable, use envelope encryption with a key retrieved from OS secure storage; never store the key next to the ciphertext.
- Avoid `System.put_env/2` for secrets; keep them in memory and inject into clients at call time.
- Redact secrets from logs; ensure log rotation per-user under app-data `logs/`.

### 6) Updates
- Use Tauri’s auto-updater or custom flow that:
  - Downloads to temp file, verifies SHA256 + detached signature (ship a public key in the app).
  - Stops BEAM, atomically swaps binaries, keeps a rollback copy.
  - Supports staged rollout by channel (`stable`/`beta`).
- macOS: signed + notarized; Windows: Authenticode signing; both include updater signature checks.

### 7) Build & Packaging
- CI matrix: macOS for mac builds/notarization; Windows runner for Windows build/signing (avoid cross-building NIFs). Validate NIF load on each target via a smoke test.
- Tauri builds installers; Phoenix release embedded asset bundle. Keep `esbuild` pipeline and `phx.digest`.
- Entitlements: keep minimal (likely no `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` needed). Windows installer adds Start Menu shortcut and optional firewall rule for loopback port if required.
- Sidecar wiring: keep Burrito output under `burrito_out/` and **symlink** into `tauri/src-tauri` using Tauri’s expected naming (`hudson_backend-<target-triple>[.exe]`) to avoid copy steps.
- Toolchains: lock Zig versions per target (e.g., cargo-xwin + Zig 0.13.0 for Windows) to avoid build flakiness.

### 8) Networking / Firewall / Ports
- Bind Phoenix to loopback only; choose a random free port to minimize conflicts.
- Health endpoint (`/healthz`) for Tauri readiness.
- Handle firewall prompts gracefully; document that no inbound LAN access is required.

### 9) Observability & UX
- Add a diagnostics page in the UI: Neon connectivity, Shopify/OpenAI reachability, clock skew, cache status, update availability.
- Show offline/online state and queue depth in the UI; allow manual “sync now”. Add a small health indicator (🟢/🟡/🔴) in the navbar.
- Provide a conflict viewer for sync collisions; log auto-resolutions.
- Crash reporting (opt-in) with redaction; consider Sentry with consent.

### 10) Offline/Online Capability Matrix (initial)
| Feature                  | Offline | Online Required |
|--------------------------|---------|-----------------|
| View cached products     | ✅       | —               |
| View fresh products      | ❌       | ✅              |
| Create session (local)   | ✅       | —               |
| Add products to session  | ✅       | —               |
| Generate talking points  | ❌       | ✅ (OpenAI)     |
| Shopify sync             | ❌       | ✅              |
| Start live stream        | ✅       | ✅ (TikTok APIs)|

### 10) Testing/Verification
- Add automated smoke for each target:
  - Launch BEAM, hit `/healthz`, open WebView URL, verify bcrypt/lazy_html NIFs load.
  - SQLite migration + cache read/write.
  - Update flow in temp dir (download, verify, swap, rollback).
- Keep `mix precommit` green; add unit tests for the sync queue and media cache.

## ✅ Pilot Validation (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Validate core lifecycle and platform blockers before full build.

**All pilot tasks completed (2025-01-18):**
- ✅ Health endpoint (`/healthz`) added - returns JSON with timestamp
- ✅ Random loopback port selection implemented - writes `/tmp/hudson_port.json`
- ✅ First-run friendly boot - works without environment variables via secure storage pattern
- ✅ Tauri shell working - spawns BEAM, reads handshake, polls health, loads WebView
- ✅ NIFs validated on macOS ARM - bcrypt_elixir and lazy_html load successfully in Burrito binary
- ✅ SQLite Repo + auto-migrations - runs on startup, handles version tracking
- ✅ Clean lifecycle - Tauri properly spawns and terminates BEAM backend

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Launch native desktop app with embedded backend
./run_native.sh
```

**Known Limitations (Pilot):**
- macOS ARM only (cross-compilation disabled due to spaces in path breaking lazy_html Makefile)
- File-based secret storage (OS keychain integration planned for production)

## Next Steps for Production

The pilot is complete and working on macOS ARM. The following items are needed for production deployment:

### Priority 1: Core Functionality

  - Keep file-based as fallback for unsupported platforms
  - Unified `Hudson.SecureStorage` API (get/put/delete)
- **Files to modify:** `lib/hudson/desktop/bootstrap.ex` or create new adapter module

### Priority 2: Multi-Platform

**4. Cross-Platform Builds** - Expand from macOS ARM to full matrix
- **Current:** macOS ARM only via Burrito (`HUDSON_BURRITO_TARGETS=macos_arm`)
- **Targets needed:**
  - macOS Intel (x86_64-apple-darwin)
  - Windows (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)
- **Blockers:**
  - lazy_html NIF Makefile breaks with spaces in path during cross-compilation

- **Files to modify:** `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (enable updater), add update endpoint

**8. Diagnostics UI** - Health dashboard
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **What's needed:**
  - LiveView page showing: Neon connectivity, Shopify/OpenAI reachability, sync queue depth, cache stats
  - Online/offline indicator in navbar
  - Manual "Sync Now" button
- **Files to create:** `lib/hudson_web/live/diagnostics_live.ex`

## Timeline & Effort Estimation

**Remaining Estimated Duration:** 16-18 working days (Phase 1 complete)

| Phase | Tasks | Duration | Dependencies | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | Tauri setup, Burrito config, health endpoint, port handshake | 2 days | — | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 2: Data Layer** | Sync worker, conflict resolution, schema versioning | 4 days | Phase 1 | SQLite Repo ✅, Sync worker ❌ |
| **Phase 3: Credentials** | OS keychain/DPAPI integration, secure storage module | 2 days | Phase 1 | File-based ✅, OS keychain ❌ |
| **Phase 4: Media Cache** | Req-based cache, LRU/TTL logic, prefetch | 1 day | Phase 2 | ❌ Not started |
| **Phase 5: Updates** | Tauri updater, signature verification, rollback | 2 days | Phase 1 | ❌ Not started |
| **Phase 6: UX & Diagnostics** | Settings UI, health indicators, conflict viewer, first-run wizard | 3 days | Phase 2, 3 | ❌ Not started |
| **Phase 7: Build & CI/CD** | GitHub Actions, code signing, notarization, installers | 2 days | All above | ❌ Not started |
| **Phase 8: Testing** | Multi-platform testing, offline scenarios, NIF validation | 2-3 days | All above | macOS ARM ✅, others ❌ |

**Critical Path:** Phase 2 (sync worker) → Phase 6 (first-run wizard) → Phase 7 (CI/CD) → Phase 8 (multi-platform testing)

## Dependencies & Tooling Requirements

### Development Machine Setup

**Required:**
- Elixir 1.15+ and Erlang/OTP 26+
- Rust 1.70+ (for Tauri)
- Zig 0.13.0 (exact version for Burrito Windows builds)
- Node.js 18+ (for Tauri CLI, not for Phoenix assets)
- Git

**Platform-Specific:**
- **macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools, Apple Developer account/certificates
- **Windows:** Visual Studio Build Tools 2019+, Windows SDK

**Install Commands:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install elixir rust zig@0.13.0 node
rustup update stable

# Tauri CLI
cargo install tauri-cli

# Windows cross-compilation (from macOS/Linux)
cargo install cargo-xwin
```

### Elixir Dependencies (validation)

**These dependencies are already in `mix.exs`; keep versions aligned when updating the desktop toolchain:**

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    # ... existing deps
    {:burrito, "~> 1.5", runtime: false},  # ❌ Not yet added
    {:ecto_sqlite3, "~> 0.9"},             # ❌ Not yet added
    {:req, "~> 0.5"},                      # ✅ Already present
    # Secure storage adapters (choose approach in Phase 3)
    # Option A: Use Tauri Rust bridge via Port (recommended)
    # Option B: {:ex_os_keychain, "~> 0.1"} for pure Elixir macOS
    # Option C: File-based envelope encryption (fallback)
  ]
end
```

### Rust Dependencies (Cargo.toml in src-tauri/)

Tauri workspace already exists; keep these dependencies in sync when upgrading:

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri = { version = "1.5", features = ["shell-open"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }

[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]
security-framework = "2.9"  # For keychain access (if implementing secure storage in Rust)

[target.'cfg(target_os = "windows")'.dependencies]
windows = { version = "0.51", features = ["Win32_Security_Credentials"] }  # For DPAPI
```

## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This workflow is ILLUSTRATIVE and will not work until:**
1. ✅ Tauri workspace exists (`src-tauri/` directory)
2. 🔄 Release-ready build/link scripts are added (current manual helpers under `scripts/`).
3. ✅ Burrito configured in `mix.exs` (targets controlled via `HUDSON_BURRITO_TARGETS`)
4. ✅ Apple certificates added to GitHub Secrets (if deploying macOS)

**Do not push a tag to trigger this workflow until prerequisites are complete.**

## Error Handling & Graceful Degradation

### Startup Failure Scenarios

| Scenario | Detection | Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| No credentials configured | `Hudson.SecureStorage.get("neon_url") == nil` | Redirect to first-run wizard |
| Neon unreachable | Connection timeout > 10s | Start in offline mode, show banner |
| Neon schema too new | `neon_version > expected_version` | Block startup, show "Update Required" dialog |
| SQLite corruption | `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.query!` raises | Delete local.db, re-sync from Neon, log incident |
| Port conflict | `Bandit.start_link` fails | Retry with 3 random ports, then error |
| NIF load failure | `bcrypt_elixir` or `lazy_html` error | Log to file, show "Installation corrupted" dialog |

### Runtime Failure Scenarios

| Scenario | Detection | Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Neon connection lost | Active query fails | Queue writes, show offline indicator |
| Shopify API rate limit | HTTP 429 response | Exponential backoff, show sync delay estimate |
| OpenAI API failure | HTTP 5xx or timeout | Retry 3x, then disable AI features temporarily |
| Disk cache full | Write fails | Evict LRU entries, reduce cache cap by 20% |
| Sync conflict | Timestamp collision | Log conflict, apply domain rule, notify user if manual resolution needed |

### Recovery Mechanisms

```elixir
# lib/hudson/sync/circuit_breaker.ex
defmodule Hudson.Sync.CircuitBreaker do
  use GenServer

  # State: :closed (healthy), :open (failing), :half_open (testing)
  # Open after 5 consecutive failures
  # Half-open after 60s
  # Close after 1 successful request in half-open

  def call(fun) do
    case get_state() do
      :closed -> try_request(fun)
      :open -> {:error, :circuit_open}
      :half_open -> test_request(fun)
    end
  end
end
```

## First-Run Setup Flow (UX)

### Initial Launch Sequence

1. **App starts** → Tauri boots → BEAM spawns
2. **No credentials found** → `Hudson.SecureStorage.first_run? == true`
3. **WebView loads** → `/setup/welcome` (bypasses auth check)
4. **Setup wizard** (LiveView multi-step form):
   - **Step 1:** Welcome screen with product explanation
   - **Step 2:** Neon database URL input + test connection button
   - **Step 3:** Shopify credentials (store name + access token) + test
   - **Step 4:** OpenAI API key + test
   - **Step 5:** Initial sync (pull products from Shopify → SQLite)
   - **Step 6:** Success screen → redirect to `/sessions`

### Credential Validation UI

```elixir
# lib/hudson_web/live/setup_live/credentials.ex
def handle_event("test_neon", %{"url" => url}, socket) do
  case Hudson.Sync.test_connection(url) do
    {:ok, version} ->
      {:noreply,
       socket
       |> assign(:neon_status, :success)
       |> assign(:neon_version, version)
       |> put_flash(:info, "Connected to Neon (schema v#{version})")}

    {:error, reason} ->
      {:noreply,
       socket
       |> assign(:neon_status, :error)
       |> put_flash(:error, "Connection failed: #{reason}")}
  end
end
```

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Credential theft from disk | Store in OS keychain/DPAPI, never plaintext |
| Man-in-the-middle (Neon) | TLS 1.3+, verify Neon certificates |
| Binary tampering | Code sign + notarize, updater checks signatures |
| Log file secrets | Redact `DATABASE_URL`, API keys via Logger backend filter |
| Memory dumps | Use `:crypto.strong_rand_bytes` for secrets, avoid `System.put_env` |
| Malicious updates | GPG-signed release metadata, checksum verification |

### Secret Redaction

```elixir
# config/runtime.exs
config :logger, :console,
  format: {Hudson.LogFormatter, :format},
  metadata: [:request_id]

# lib/hudson/log_formatter.ex
defmodule Hudson.LogFormatter do
  @moduledoc """
  Custom log formatter that redacts sensitive information.
  """

  def format(level, message, timestamp, metadata) do
    # Default formatting
    formatted_message = Logger.Formatter.format(
      "$time $metadata[$level] $message\n",
      level,
      message,
      timestamp,
      metadata
    )

    # Redact secrets
    formatted_message
    |> to_string()
    |> redact(~r/DATABASE_URL=[^\s]+/, "DATABASE_URL=***")
    |> redact(~r/postgres:\/\/[^\s]+/, "postgres://***")
    |> redact(~r/sk-[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+/, "sk-***")  # OpenAI keys
    |> redact(~r/shpat_[a-f0-9]+/, "shpat_***")  # Shopify tokens
  end

  defp redact(string, pattern, replacement) do
    String.replace(string, pattern, replacement)
  end
end
```

## Notes on Current Code Risks (to address as part of the move)
- `config/runtime.exs` currently raises on missing `DATABASE_URL`/`SECRET_KEY_BASE`, which will block first-run in desktop mode; needs the new bootstrap flow.
- Client-side migrations against Neon would be risky; shift to CI-run only.
- Credentials are presently configured via env; move to secure storage and avoid env mutation for secrets.
